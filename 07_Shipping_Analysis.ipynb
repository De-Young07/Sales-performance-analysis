# Shipping Analysis

## Analyzing Shipping Delays

This notebook analyzes shipping delays based on different shipping modes, correlates the ship delay with profit, and measures shipping efficiency.

# Required Libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_data.csv')  # Please update with your dataset path

# Data Overview
df.head()

# Convert ship date and delivery date to datetime
#df['Ship Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Ship Date'])
#df['Delivery Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Delivery Date'])

# Calculate shipping delay
df['Shipping Delay'] = (df['Delivery Date'] - df['Ship Date']).dt.days

# Analyzing shipping delays by mode
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Ship Mode', y='Shipping Delay', data=df)
plt.title('Shipping Delays by Ship Mode')
plt.xlabel('Ship Mode')
plt.ylabel('Shipping Delay (days)')
plt.show()

# Correlating ship delay with profit
correlation = df[['Shipping Delay', 'Profit']].corr().iloc[0, 1]
print(f'Correlation between Shipping Delay and Profit: {correlation}')

# Measuring shipping efficiency
df['Efficiency'] = df['Profit'] / df['Shipping Delay']

# Visualizing shipping efficiency
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Ship Mode', y='Efficiency', data=df)
plt.title('Shipping Efficiency by Ship Mode')
plt.xlabel('Ship Mode')
plt.ylabel('Efficiency (Profit per Delay)')
